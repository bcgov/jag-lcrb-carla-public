        A co-packer is a liquor packaging facility that is contracted by a manufacturer to bottle or otherwise put liquor into containers intended for sale to the public or to other licensees.
        The licence for co-packers authorizes manufacturing activities limited to the packaging, bottling, blending, and flavouring of liquor on behalf of a licensed winery, brewery, or distillery.
        In a co-packing arrangement, the product is always owned by the manufacturer (not the co-packer) and must be immediately returned to the manufacturer once the packaging is complete.
        The licence for co-packers does not authorize the fermenting, distilling or direct sale of liquor.
        It is the responsibility of both the manufacturer (winery, brewery or distillery) and the co-packer to ensure that the other party is licensed by the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch.
