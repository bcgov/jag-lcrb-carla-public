      <p>Please provide proof from your local government that the proposed location has been:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>appropriately zoned to operate a {{application?.licenseType}} licence, or</li>
        <li>is in the process of being appropriately zoned</li>

      <p>
        You are responsible for obtaining the appropriate zoning from your local
        government to operate a {{application?.licenseType}} licence at your proposed location.
        Prior to issuing a licence at the new location, LCRB will require confirmation
        from your local government that the location is zoned appropriately to operate
        a WS licence.
