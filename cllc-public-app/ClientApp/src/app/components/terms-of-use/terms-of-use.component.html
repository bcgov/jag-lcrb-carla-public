<h2>Authentication:</h2>
<ol start="9">
  <li>
    Only an individual who is an authorized representative (“Representative”) of an Applicant may access the

    other than an Applicant that is an Indigenous nation applying in its own name, must have a Business BCeID and
    designate a unique “User Login ID” to each Representative that is entitled to access and modify the Applicant’s
    application for a Licence. An Applicant that is an Indigenous nation applying in its own name must have a
    Business BCeID registered as “Other”. Each Representative must be at least 19 years of age.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each time a Representative accesses the Site, they must be authenticated by following an external link to the

    portions of, the Site.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Payment:</h2>
<ol start="11">

    A Representative will be required to access an external payment processing site (“Payment Site”) in order to pay

      </li>
      <li>
