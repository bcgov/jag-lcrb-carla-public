          Manager to request a Business BCeID user account. B.C. residents will need a Photo BC Services Card for the
          security screening and financial integrity check. See <a href='http://www.gov.bc.ca/bcservicescardhelp'
            target='_blank'>www.gov.bc.ca/bcservicescardhelp</a> for how to set up a BC Services Card. If it is
          necessary for the applicant to visit a service counter to complete Business BCeID registration, the applicant
          should consider setting up their BC Services Card at the same time.</p>

        <p>Restrictions will be placed on a retail store that has a close business, financial or family connection to a
          producer. Licensees will not be permitted to enter agreements to sell a producer’s product in preference to

          that the association between the licensee and producer is so close that the licensee is likely to promote the
          sale of cannabis of the federally licensed producer. In making this determination, the LCRB will consider
          whether:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The licensee holds or has a beneficial interest in, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the producer's
            voting shares</li>
          <li>An immediate family member has any financial interest in the producer</li>
