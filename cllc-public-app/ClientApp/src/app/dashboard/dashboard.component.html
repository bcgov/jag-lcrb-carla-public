        accessories in British
        Columbia.

      <p>
        To apply for a non-medical cannabis retail store licence, applicants must submit a completed

        accompanying
        the application form can assist in completing all required documentation.</p>
      <p>Please note that applications which are submitted without all required information or documents will not be
        processed.
        Applicants will be contacted and provided the opportunity to submit missing information. Once applicants
        provide
        all required documents to the LCRB, the application will be submitted for processing.</p>
